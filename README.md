# UNP_REGRESSION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_STEEL_INDUSTRY_ANALYSIS

This project applies regression analysis in Python to predict and analyze energy consumption patterns in a steel manufacturing plant. The dataset includes parameters such as Usage (kWh), Reactive Power, Power Factors, CO₂ emissions, and Load Type. The workflow covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier treatment, and multiple linear regression modeling using libraries like pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

The model achieved an R² score of approximately 0.73, indicating strong predictive performance. Insights from the analysis highlight key contributors to energy usage, helping industries make data-driven decisions for energy optimization and sustainability.
